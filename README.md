# seezer
Pronouncable caeser ciphers

Usage: `$ python caeser.py` or `>>> import seezer; seezer.encipher(string,key)`

You will be prompted with for a string and a cipher value. The string will be encoded using a series of shifts each containing similar-behaving letters. The higher the cipher value, the more similar the enciphered phrase will be to it's original counterpart. Use negative values to reverse a cipher.

Seezer works best on the English Language. However, an experimental Spanish Mode is available. Change `letterLists = languages.english` to `letterLists = languages.spanish` to enable it.
